# Intraservice Arbetsprov ‚Äì Registration Form

Welcome! This project is a work test for G√∂teborg's city IntraService. It demonstrates my ability to build a modern, maintainable, and user-friendly fullstack web application using React, TypeScript, Vite, and Express.

## ‚ú® Project Overview

This application is a registration form for a camp activity event. It features:

- **Modern React (with hooks) and TypeScript** for type safety and maintainability
- **Reusable, generic form components** (Button, InputField, Dropdown, Section, ValidationMessage)
- **Clean separation of concerns**: data fetching and business logic are handled at the page level, while the form component is fully generic and reusable
- **Server-side validation** with clear error and success feedback
- **Accessible and responsive UI** styled with Tailwind CSS
- **Consistent error and success messaging**
- **Dropdown with outside click handling** for a modern UX

## üß† My Process & Reasoning

### 1. **Componentization & Reusability**
- I started by breaking down the UI into small, focused components (Button, InputField, Dropdown, etc.).
- The form logic was initially inside the form component, but I refactored it to make the form fully generic, so it can be reused for any similar registration or selection scenario.
- All business logic (fetching options, handling submit, error/success state) is handled in the page, keeping the form component clean and focused on UI and user input.

### 2. **Type Safety & Clean Code**
- All components and handlers are fully typed with TypeScript.
- I removed all unused code, redundant props, and ensured all interfaces are minimal and clear.
- I added concise comments and file-level documentation for maintainability.

### 3. **User Experience**
- The form resets after a successful submission, which is standard for registration flows.
- The dropdown closes when clicking outside, and the UI is responsive and accessible.
- Success and error messages are visually distinct and use a consistent, accessible component.

### 4. **Server & Validation**
- The Express backend provides activities and handles registration with robust validation and clear error messages.
- All server routes are documented and use proper status codes.
